If you have installed a previous version of AoC2.5, please note that the language text you installed before is not needed in the game/languages/Bundle.properties file, as the game code now loads 2.5's language files in a seperate designated folder in game/languages/twopointfive. You may navigate to the language bundle file you altered and restore it back to its original state (delete the key-value pair lines from "# Age of Civilizations 2.5 Language Additions" onwards) if you prefer.

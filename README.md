Up-to-date Age of Civilizations 2.5 "engine" source code

Editted code of Lukasz Jakowski's Age of Civilizations 2, mix of Fernflower and CFR decompiler.
Not all AoC2 Java files are included, so you must establish the AoC2.jar base code as a dependancy in whatever IDE you use.
Make sure the .Jar is the newest version of AoC2 (older versions will likely error due to incompatibility).
My incoherent comments are scattered throughout to serve as a guide, but message on here or discord if help is needed.

Pull requests, issue/bug reporting, and general suggestions are greatly appreciated.
If you are wish to make fork and make significant alterations, please give credit as one of the base authors if possible.
I have spent quite some excruciating hours of my life creating this mod.

Thanks!

Official installation guides and downloads for playthrough are on both the discord and youtube.
